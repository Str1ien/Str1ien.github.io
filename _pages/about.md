Computer Science graduate & research intern at UNIZAR, currently working w/ [Pedro √Ålvarez](https://janovas.unizar.es/sideral/CV/pedro-javier-alvarez-perezaradros), [Carlos Bobed](https://webdiis.unizar.es/people/cbobed/) & [Razvan Raducu](https://razvioverflow.github.io/) in the research team [reversea.me](https://reversea.me/), part of the [DisCo](https://webdiis.unizar.es/DISCO/) group. During my time here our work has been focused on malware classification and building tools and models based on captured execution behaviour from these binaries.

At the same time, I've just finished my bachelor's degree on Computer Science at UNIZAR, having obtained several honors throughout my studies and participated in different extracurricular activities such as mentoring, class and student representation and volunteering at different events (see more in my cv).
