Computer Science & research intern at UNIZAR, currently working w/ [Pedro Álvarez](https://janovas.unizar.es/sideral/CV/pedro-javier-alvarez-perezaradros), [Ricardo J. Rodríguez](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/) & [Razvan Raducu](https://razvioverflow.github.io/) in the research team [reversea.me](https://reversea.me/), part of the [DisCo](https://webdiis.unizar.es/DISCO/) group. During my time here our work has been focused on malware detection and classification, building tools and models based on captured execution behaviour from these binaries.

At the same time, I'm currently on my 4th (and final) year of the bachelor's degree of Computer Science at UNIZAR, having obtained several honors throughout my studies and participated in different extracurricular activities such as mentoring, class and student representation and volunteering at different events (see more in my cv).
